IST 256 Final Project
Description: Think of a company name and create a logo, tagline, and mission statement. Your store needs to sell a minimum of 10 products with descriptions. Customers will need to be able to create an account. Be able to select items into a shopping cart. Then be they must be able to check out.

Additional Notes
For login purposes: admin as user id and admin as password works to be able to see welcome page. Also making an account works to make it to the welcome page. Accounts have password requirements (8 characters or longer with at least one special character).
